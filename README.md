# Colab Application: Gemini API Details Exploration

This repository hosts a Google Colab notebook designed for exploring the Google Gemini API. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide for various tasks, including text-to-image generation and image editing using Gemini.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To start using this notebook, follow these instructions:

1. **Open the Colab Notebook:**
   - Click the following link to open the notebook in Google Colab: [Google Colab Notebook](https://github.com/elifkeskin/Gemini_API_Details/blob/main/gemini_api_details_pynb.py)

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed. You can either:
     - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your local environment, or
     - Execute the installation commands directly in the Colab notebook (usually in the first cell).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Curl Request Examples:** Demonstrates how to interact with the Gemini API using curl commands.
- **Google SDK Examples:** Provides code snippets using the official Google SDK for Gemini.
- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Guides you through generating images from text prompts using the Gemini API.
- **Image Editing with Gemini:** Shows how to edit existing images using text instructions with the Gemini API.
- **Watermark Cleaning Test:** Includes examples for testing the API's ability to remove watermarks from images.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

This notebook requires the following Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, if you are using Google Colab, you can install the dependencies directly in the notebook using the following command:

```bash
!pip install <package-name>
```
Replace <package-name> with the specific library you need to install (e.g., google-generativeai, pillow).
